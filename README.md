# Fello-goni-kuriera
That was my very first own game. The goal was to move a dog with WSAD to bite the curier. You have to avoid flying packages because everytime you touch one, it take you 1 of you 3 lives. When you touch the curier the game is over, you won and on the center of the screen displays a message about your victory.  
If you lost you all lives you lose the game and the message says that curier wins.  
This game was created to practise paython and the inspiration is my dog Fello who hates curiers.
